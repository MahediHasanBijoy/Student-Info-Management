## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

I have learned file system in php and how to use them as temporary data storage. Taking user input as a text file and validate that file so that other file cannot be uploaded was a challenge. I have solved it with the file extension check before upload the file.
